# Delauney Triangulation

This is my implementation of the delauney triangulation algorithm utilising the game library Raylib for drawing. This is written in C++ and is purely a project used to understand the delauney triangulation algorithm. Under no circumstance should this be used for actual production code however this was a great learning exercise. 

To compile and run you must place the library file for raylib into the lib folder with the name libraylib.a 

I hope you enjoy thanks!
